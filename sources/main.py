Write a github README for "machine-learning-for-algorithmic-trading":

Chapter 1, Machine Learning for Trading – From Idea to Execution,
summarizes how and why ML became important for trading,
describes the investment process, and outlines how ML can add
value.
Chapter 2, Market and Fundamental Data – Sources and Techniques,
covers how to source and work with market data, including
exchange-provided tick data, and reported ﬁnancials.
Chapter 3, Alternative Data for Finance – Categories and Use Cases,
explains categories and criteria to assess the exploding number of
sources and providers. 
Chapter 4, Financial Feature Engineering – How to Research Alpha
Factors, presents the process of creating and evaluating data
transformations
Chapter 5, Portfolio Optimization and Performance Evaluation,
introduces how to manage, optimize, and evaluate a portfolio
resulting from the execution of a strategy.
Chapter 6, The Machine Learning Process, sets the stage by outlining
how to formulate, train, tune, and evaluate the predictive
performance of ML models in a systematic way
Chapter 7, Linear Models – From Risk Factors to Return Forecasts,
shows how to use linear and logistic regression for inference and
prediction and how to use regularization to manage the risk of
overﬁ ing.
Chapter 8, The ML4T Workﬂow – From Model to Strategy Backtesting,
integrates the various building blocks of the ML4T workﬂow thus
far discussed separately.
Chapter 9, Time-Series Models for Volatility Forecasts and Statistical
Arbitrage, covers univariate and multivariate time series diagnostics
and models, including vector autoregressive models as well as
ARCH/GARCH models for volatility forecasts.
Chapter 10, Bayesian ML – Dynamic Sharpe Ratios and Pairs Trading,
presents probabilistic models and how Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling and variational Bayes facilitate approximate
inference.
Chapter 11, Random Forests – A Long-Short Strategy for Japanese
Stocks, shows how to build, train, and tune nonlinear tree-based
models for insight and prediction.
Chapter 12, Boosting Your Trading Strategy, introduces gradient
boosting and demonstrates how to use the libraries XGBoost,
LightBGM, and CatBoost for high-performance training and
prediction.
Chapter 13, Data-Driven Risk Factors and Asset Allocation with
Unsupervised Learning, shows how to use dimensionality reduction
and clustering for algorithmic trading.
Chapter 14, Text Data for Trading – Sentiment Analysis, demonstrates
how to convert text data into a numerical format and applies the
classiﬁcation algorithms.
Chapter 15, Topic Modeling – Summarizing Financial News, uses
unsupervised learning to extract topics that summarize a large
number of documents and oﬀer more eﬀective ways to explore text
data or use topics as features for a classiﬁcation model.
Chapter 16, Word Embeddings for Earnings Calls and SEC Filings, uses
neural networks to learn state-of-the-art language features in the
form of word vectors
Chapter 17, Deep Learning for Trading, introduces TensorFlow 2 and
PyTorch, the most popular deep learning frameworks
Chapter 18, CNNs for Financial Time Series and Satellite Images,
covers convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are very
powerful for classiﬁcation tasks with unstructured data at scale.
Chapter 19, RNNs for Multivariate Time Series and Sentiment Analysis,
shows how recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are useful for
sequence-to-sequence modeling, including for univariate and
multivariate time series to predict.
Chapter 20, Autoencoders for Conditional Risk Factors and Asset Pricing,
covers autoencoders for the nonlinear compression of high-
dimensional data.
Chapter 21, Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthetic Time-Series
Data, presents one of the most exciting advances in deep learning.
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are capable of learning to
reproduce synthetic replicas of a target data type.
Chapter 22, Deep Reinforcement Learning – Building a Trading Agent,
presents how reinforcement learning (RL) permits the design and
training of agents that learn to optimize decisions over time in
response to their environment.
